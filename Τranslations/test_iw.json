In fact, the condition improved dramatically and years of suffering came to an end. It turned out this experience was not unusual.\n\n<b>The answers are out there.</b> The individuals who have tried various treatments know best what has worked. All that’s missing is a way to empower them to share this data in an organized fashion that’s optimized for analysis. Similar to how Waze sought to empower people to build maps and share data to help each other bypass traffic, here, too, crowdsourcing presents the optimal solution to a large scale problem."

Researchers use PROs to study conditions in depth, and they can offer doctors a more holistic view of their patients’ health status. PROs can also be used to triage patients, identify comorbidities and help reduce side effects.\n\nTraditionally, PROs are gathered within the context of a study or by a doctor. There has never been a way to gather PROs on a large scale or on an on-going basis, from the vast majority of patients who are not actively taking part in a study or reporting on their experiences.\n\nWith the StuffThatWorks platform, vast numbers of community members contribute PROs on an ongoing basis, adding new data to the knowledge base in real time, and sharing their experiences with different treatments. Because the data on StuffThatWorks is dynamic and updated regularly, it is particularly valuable for advancing research and medical discoveries."

It offers a real-time picture of disease by harnessing information as individuals are diagnosed or even before, and thus it is uniquely positioned to improve diagnostics and surveillance of illness. By gathering large numbers of PROs, we are also able to learn about aspects of disease dynamics that are not accessible through traditional data, such as contact patterns and aspects of the social environment."

The models account for member biases towards certain types of treatments as well as biases that arise from the specific demographic distribution of our members. As more data is collected, the models become more personalized and are able to better account for these biases.

The research potential that such information entails is staggering.\nFirst, the map is diagnostic in nature: it places users on the map without accounting for their formal diagnosis, and only later we color the dots according to said diagnosis. That means that potentially, the map can identify misdiagnosis - when a yellow dot appears in a sea of red, for example, or when someone is placed in the very periphery of his conditions’ “neighborhood”. It can also tell how “typical” someone’s condition is - possibly informing the patient and their doctors of alternative approaches for treatment beyond the baseline protocol.\nSince it is based on individual similarities, it also allows each user to locate and even contact those who resemble them - not just members of the condition at large, but those who most likely experience the condition in the most similar way. The advice and inputs that such connections might entail can prove crucial.\nThe map also offers an exploration of the connection and similarities between the different conditions as a whole. The data collection process is consistent, organized and unified across all conditions, and therefore allows a comparative view of them side-by-side. Overlaps and proximity, for example, might suggest a more meaningful, perhaps even clinical, connection which can then be further explored by medical researchers. \nFurthermore, since the map is constantly and automatically updating, new information - and new conditions, as well - are easily and quickly incorporated into the map, allowing new insights about lesser-known conditions to emerge - such as the Long-COVID and Fibromyalgia finding."

In fact, our condition fit model creates a user embedding of 512 dimensions, which means that each user is represented by 512 different numbers.\nThis representation is then squeezed down to two dimensions - X and Y - through a process called dimensionality reduction. There are different approaches to dimensionality reduction, but we use an approach called t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding). The way it works is as follows: first, it calculates the distances between each point and its nearest neighbors in the full embedding space, then it creates a new embedding with the chosen number of dimensions (in our instance, two). It then optimizes this new embedding space to try and preserve as much as possible the same distances proportionally between nearest neighbors as in the original space."

It’s also quite infuriating, especially if you consider just how much time and resources most chronically ill people invest in the search for a miracle remedy or even moderate relief.\n\nFinding what works for people living with chronic conditions is an ongoing challenge for both patients and the medical community. Academic studies conducted on small samples of population in laboratory conditions often lack mass applicability. The reason for that is obvious; large-scale studies over lengthy periods of time are costly. Moreover, no matter how extensive and expensive a study is, the results can never truly reflect real world experiences (RWE) for a large enough sample of the observed population.\n\nIntegrating RWE data into medical research has long been the golden grail of researchers looking to gain educated insights of the efficacy of treatments for chronic conditions. Up until recently this gap was technically impossible to bridge."

What the medical community and patients need is the opposite: statistically viable information about what has worked best and for whom.\n\nThis urgent and critical need, combined with the technologies available for machine learning and big data, led us to create StuffThatWorks.health - a one-of-a-kind database of real world experience data collected from people living with various chronic conditions and trying different solutions and treatments."

This is why StuffThatWorks allows anyone to start a community for their specific condition and invite others to share their experience and knowledge. \n\nAt StuffThatWorks you will find people just like you sharing their experience and discovering together what works over time.

She is an associate professor in pediatrics at the Sackler School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University.\n\nDr. Rothschild received her medical degree at the Paris XII Kremlin-Bicetre Medical School before moving to Israel where she completed her pediatric residency at the Meir Medical Center. During her time at Meir, she created the pediatric day care unit. She went on to sub-specialize in medical genetics at the Sheba Medical Center, and then returned to France to pursue a one-year research fellowship at Necker Enfants-Malades Hospital in the Genetic Department, where her studies focused on uncovering the genetic cause of a rare lysosomal disease.\n\nFollowing her fellowship, Dr. Rothschild joined the team at Hadassah Medical Center as a senior pediatric medical geneticist. In this role, she treated patients with rare lysosomal storage diseases, while also teaching genetics at the Hebrew University Medical School where she was an assistant professor.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Dr. Rothschild headed the Genetics Department at Meir Medical Center. In 2014, she moved to her current position at the Sheba Medical Center as the Director of the Institute for Rare Diseases. From 2013-2014,  Dr. Rothschild served on the Commission for Rare Diseases in the Israeli Ministry of Health, and she is the current Israeli Coordinator for the Orphanet Rare Disease European consortium."

Crowdsourced data is crucial to offering better care for patients.\n\nIn my vision, the value of crowdsourcing is that it offers a much needed addition of information directly from the people affected by illness, and it allows for cooperation among parents, medical teams, pharmaceutical companies, decision makers and more. <b>StuffThatWorks is needed in order to provide better care for the community of patients with rare diseases.</b>"

But Bethan’s message is that although it can mean difficulties getting pregnant, it should also be seen and treated as an overall medical condition – one that can cause significant weight gain that is not easily remedied by intensive exercise and diet, as well as blood sugar spikes, irregular periods, inflammation and hair loss.

But now, with the diagnosis, depression and loneliness set in. At the same time, however, so did a measure of denial. Heather, intent on distracting herself, continued to go out frequently with her hard-partying friends. That is, of course, until her body crashed and she realized she had to retool her life, all the way down to the way she socialized and made friends.

I did this as soon as I could following onset of my symptoms. I also started taking 1000UI Vitamin D daily because Vitamin D is a treatment for Multiple Sclerosis (which is also caused by the demyelination of neurons; the understanding being that Parosmia is demyelination of neurons in olfactory nerve/bulb in the brain). These treatments along with exercise, a healthy diet and smell therapy, I have recovered a few weeks after the onset of Parosmia."

I have also learned to allow myself to step away from the situation and revisit it later when I am calm, rational and ready. In my phone photo gallery, I created a folder with random pictures and downloaded videos that made me laugh out loud when I saw them on Facebook and TikTok, named it LOLs; another folder I named SparkHearts for things that warm my heart when I see them.
